# Credit Risk Modeling & Predictive Analysis

## Overview
This repository presents a **Data Science project focused on Credit Risk Modeling**, developed during an internship at the **Central Bank of Tunisia**. The project demonstrates how statistical methods, survival analysis, and machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze credit risk, model default dynamics, and support risk management decisions.

This project is intended to showcase **analytical, quantitative, and programming skills** in a banking and financial risk context.

## Project Context

- **Author:** Emna Turki  
- **Internship:** Data Science Intern – Risk Analytics  
- **Institution:** Banque de Tunisie  
- **Period:** July 2025 – August 2025

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze the evolution of **credit risk stages** over time
- Model credit migrations using **Markov chains**
- Estimate **Expected Credit Loss (ECL)**
- Study balance run-off and cancellation behavior
- Apply **survival analysis** techniques (Kaplan–Meier, parametric models, Weibull AFT)
- Quantify risk using **Value at Risk (VaR)**
- Build **machine learning models** for credit risk prediction

The notebook contains the complete analytical pipeline:
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Credit risk modeling (Markov chains, ECL)  
4. Survival analysis and parametric modeling  
5. Predictive modeling using machine learning

## Data Description

The analysis is based on **internal and anonymized banking data**, including:

- Credit risk stages and historical transitions  
- Account balances and run-off information  
- Time-based observations at the client level

No raw or sensitive client information is disclosed.
